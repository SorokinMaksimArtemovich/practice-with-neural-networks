# practice-with-neural-networks
In this directory I post my notebooks where I had worked with some datasets from kaggle when I learn new architectures of neural networks:
- In IndianBirds_clf_with_simple_CNN.ipynb from "cv" folder I classify indian birds from dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjunbasandrai/25-indian-bird-species-with-226k-images on 25 classes with simple CNN.
- In ImageSegmentation_with_u_net.ipynb from "cv" folder I highlight flooded areas from dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/faizalkarim/flood-area-segmentation with U-Net.
- In ru_eng_translation_with_transformer.ipynb from "nlp" folder I translate sentences from dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hijest/englishrussian-dictionary-for-machine-translate from english to russian with transformer.
